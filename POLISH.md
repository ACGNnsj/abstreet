# Polish

Overlapping with TODO.md and docs/backlog.md, we have... a new list of visible
things needing polish!

- sometimes UI zooms in at once, then unzooms slowly
- sidewalk paths start in building centers and end in sidewalk centers
	- this is probably fine to show agents moving, but at least draw
	  building layer before sidewalk layer
- the colors are awful
- different lane markings
	- sidewalks with little horizontal lines
	- parking with... circled P's and maybe partial horizontal lines to
	  show spots?
	- copy the green Seattle color scheme for bike lanes
