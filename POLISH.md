# Polish

Overlapping with TODO.md and docs/backlog.md, we have... a new list of visible
things needing polish!

## Just appearance

- new center polylines
	- explode out at some angles
- different lane markings
	- dashed yellow center lines (and later, white lines for multiple road lanes)
	- sidewalks with little horizontal lines
	- parking with... circled P's and https://nacto.org/wp-content/uploads/gallery/sharedlane_3d/shared-lane_urban_street.jpg
	- copy the green Seattle color scheme for bike lanes?


- sidewalk paths start in building centers and end in sidewalk centers
	- this is probably fine to show agents moving, but at least draw
	  building layer before sidewalk layer
- the colors are awful

## Interaction

- sometimes UI zooms in at once, then unzooms slowly
