# Project motivation

"Only with simple, accessible simulation programs can citizens become active
generators of their own urban visions, not just passive recipients of options
laid out by government officials."

## Open questions

Why is crowdsourcing useful? People have specific expertise, more investment in hyper-local changes.

Why don't people participate today? Apathy, lack of access, lack of expertise, gov wont do anything with feedback?

Why do people participate in Seattle despite having something like A/B Street?

## Why now?

Emphasis on long-term or very disruptive changes (AVs, eventual light rail).
AVs could be a forcing function to re-evaluate how space in a city is
allocated.

## Project outcomes

Best and worst cases (just a game, inspire, actually cause changes)
