# Desired team

## UX

- How should compatible functionality (like following an agent and showing its
  route) work simultaneously? What functions should remain mutually exclusive
  (showing chokepoints and editing lanes)?
- How should the modal side menus, bottom status bar, right click menus, top
  menu, etc be designed?
- Is it confusing to let people edit a map while a simulation is running?
- How should edits to a map be visualized?
- How should traffic be depicted when unzoomed?
- Please sketch how a traffic signal's current state be displayed. What about
  editing a traffic signal?
- How to show A/B test results live as a simulation runs?
- Multiple overlapping pedestrians?
- Redesign how cars look, including turn signals
- How to depict demand data?
- What would you change about the way the map is currently displayed? (Building
  types, front paths, intersection colors, stop signs, colors)
