# Halloween visual demo

- cars with headlights
- pumpkins
- fences / bushes / features in houses (maybe fences around parcel boundaries?) or triangulation on a block with buildings
- buildings as rooms in a hotel
- silent hill soundtrack
= deformed buildings pulsing on front path springs
- lighting?
- fog effects
- in 3D, what if roads are sunken rivers and buildings giant skyscrapers?
- eyes on the houses, that blink
