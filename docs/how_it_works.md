# How A/B Street works

- caveats: i'm not a traffic engr
- trips: psrc 2014 data. no pass-through trips.
- parking: offstreet especially guessed
- movement: lane-changing, overtaking, acceleration
- buses, light rail
- bike trails

shouldnt replace other modeling, planning -- just an additional tool

demand NOT changing
