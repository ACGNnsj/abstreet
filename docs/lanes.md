# Brainstorm about lanes

It's time to model more things:

- multiple driving lanes, with possibly individual turn restrictions
- dedicated bus lanes
- lanes with parked cars
- bike lanes
- sidewalks

Each lane needs some geometry:

- center lines to draw agents on
	- for sidewalks, use center line to to draw agents on the left and right sides?
- polygons to draw the lane and mouseover

Open questions:

- Can we assume all lanes are the same width?
	- Seems wrong for many sidewalks especially
	- Could be wrong for bike lanes, but could just assume it's a bike lane with a buffer
- Some lanes are immutable
	- Sidewalks can't be changed to other types; they're raised with a curb

Some modeling questions:

- Where should expansion of roads into lanes happen?
	- initial OSM conversion, adding more stuff to the proto?
	- initial map_model::new loading, at least for development convenience
		- same reason that turns aren't (yet) serialized
- Is it useful to model the entire road?
	- the parent/child relation may be hard to maintain
	- but lanes need to know their siblings
	- maintaining directional sanity could be useful
	- what's the UI for changing lane types?
	- it's a bit arbitrary which lane should draw the yellow center lines



Initial design:
- "Road" becomes "Lane" with a type
- don't need to know sibling lanes yet
- arbitrarily, one lane might have extra bits/geometry for yellow center line markings
- ideally, get rid of one-wayness and original center points, and plumb along pre-shifted lines
	- but due to the polyline problem (affecting both geom center line layer that agents follow, and polygons for drawing), can't do this. encapsulate the messiness at least.
	- so, store one way and orig points and index, but have an accessor
	- as a compromise, dont interpet OSM points on a one-way road as the center, but as the edge? this is proving hard to do.

Thinking about a new design:
- Much more general "Land" primitive that's just a nice polygon boundary for drawing/selection and one (or more, for sidewalks?) center lines for how to cross the space, with a notion of turns. It's what road is now, but way simpler data.
- Maybe the GeomRoad / DrawRoad split is a little confusing after all, since the layering just isn't perfect. figure out the polygon and centerline up-front, then ditch the other intermediate gunk.
- also ideally make one polygon for the road, not a bunch of individual pieces? but then we'd have to go triangulate later for opengl anyway



The polyline problem:

- Will lengths change? Is this a problem?
- Drawing cars as rectangles is funky, because if their front is aligned to a new line segment, their back juts into the center of the road
