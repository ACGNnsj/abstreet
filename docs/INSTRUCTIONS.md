This is an alpha-quality demo. Please email <dabreegster@gmail.com> or
[file a Github issue](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/issues/) if you
hit problems.

Grab a pre-built binary release -- updated every Sunday, announced at
[r/abstreet](http://old.reddit.com/r/abstreet):

- Windows:
  https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/releases/download/v0.2.0a/abstreet_windows_v0_2_0c.zip
  - If clicking buttons seems to be a bit off, might be [this issue](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/issues/65)
- Mac:
  https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/releases/download/v0.2.0a/abstreet_mac_v0_2_0a.zip

    problems.

Unzip the folder, then run `play_abstreet.sh` or `play_abstreet.bat`. On
Windows, you'll probably get a warning about running software from an unknown
publisher.
