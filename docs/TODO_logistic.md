# TODO - Project logistics

- enable more clippy lints
- enforce consistent style (derive order, struct initialization order)
- cross-platform builds

- document map model
	- diagram of data sources and stages
	- explanation of intermediate formats
	- autogenerate diagrams of the data schemas
	- list invariants

- update with mission statement (democratized urb p, that quote, refashion existing space cheaply)
- trailer
	- show common parts of routes in A/B, point of divergence
	- "Two parallel universes sit at your fingertips, and with the flick of a key, you can glide between the two. Buses jumping past traffic in one world, snarly traffic jam in the other. An A/B test revealing what currently is, and what could be, compared meticulously and deterministically. A/B Street -- which world do you prefer?"
