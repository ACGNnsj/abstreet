# TODO for Phase 4 (Game)

- Example use cases
	- montlake/520 turn restrictions with pedestrian scramble
	- close interior neighborhoods to most cars (except for src/dst), see how traffic restricted to arterials would work
	- create a bike network with minimal hills, dedicated roads, minimal crossings

- easter eggs
	- name agents, with some good names scattered in (Dustin Carlino, Dustin Bikelino, Dustin Buslino...)
