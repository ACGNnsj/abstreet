# Project plan

## Phase 1: Basemap

Produce a high-quality map of Seattle, modeling everything relevant. Input is
OSM, elevation data, King Country GIS data, etc, and also manual edits.

- Polygons shouldn't overlap
- Can export to various formats and announce for anyone's use (though waiting for the editor might be wiser)
- Have fun with themed rendering: halloween, winter, jungle, 8bit, organic (deform buildings), floorplan

## Phase 2: Editor

Have an easy UI to modify the basemap -- changing lanes and intersections mainly.

- Can use this to make the basemap more realistic, and also later for the game

## Phase 3: Simulator

Model people moving around the map.

- Will need realistic demand data for this or the next phase
- Reversible simulation would be amazing

## Phase 4: Game

Turn everything into a game by introducing tutorial levels, specific challenges, scoring, etc.

- Figure out how to represent A/B tests
