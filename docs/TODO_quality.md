# TODO - Map quality

## Geometry

- ped paths through sidewalk corners are totally broken

- figure out what to do about yellow center lines
	- yellow and white lines intersect cars and turn icons and such
	- who should own drawing them?

## More data

- lanes: https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/49d417979fec452981a068ca078e7070_3
	- not filled out for most streets
- traffic circles: https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/717b10434d4945658355eba78b66971a_6
- https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/sidewalks
	- disagrees with OSM road centers sometimes
- https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/curb-ramps
- high quality thick roads: https://seattlecitygis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=86cb6824307c4d63b8e180ebcff58ce2
- OSM has footways
	- but theyre not marked everywhere
	- and theyre hard to associate with roads (sometimes need to infer a planter strip)
- draw ALL water and greenery areas
- draw benches, bike racks
- render trees
- look for current stop sign priorities
