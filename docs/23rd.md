# Project 23rd

I specifically want to play with traffic around 23rd Ave / 520. Some vague
things that should be easy to change:

- pedestrian scramble lights for walking between Montlake and Husky Stadium
- remove some left turns and see if traffic backs up so far

## The boundary

Vague text description: bit east of gasworks, 55th, 35th ave e, down around
madison, cherry st, cut to eastlake.

Different ways of specifying the boundary:
- listing major roads at the boundary, finding the polygon from that
- manually draw in UI, then somehow refine it to exclude leftover bits
