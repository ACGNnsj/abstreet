# Backlog

## Code cleanup

- easier way to define magic tuneable constants
	- and maybe to recalculate fixedish things if they change?
- add/plan tests
- document pieces that're stabilizing
- run clippy everywhere
	- presubmit script
	- also enforce consistent style (derive order, struct initialization order)

## Conga line idea

- try constructive approach for snake idea
	- with interactive mode?

## Generally useful rust stuff

- better test runner
	- summary of pass/fail at the end, with timings
	- log output from failures to tmp files
