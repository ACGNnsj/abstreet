## Code cleanup

- easier way to define magic tuneable constants

- run clippy everywhere
	- presubmit script
	- also enforce consistent style (import order, extern crate only in mod.rs or lib.rs, derive order, struct initialization order)

## Conga line idea

- try constructive approach for snake idea
	- with interactive mode?
