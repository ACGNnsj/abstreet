## UI

- show more things
	- draw water and greenery areas
	- draw benches, bike racks
		- more generally, a way to display random GIS data from seattle site (kml)

- support massive maps
	- render to a bitmap and clip that in?
	- drop events sometimes

- 3D UI sharing the same structure as the 2D one
- svg export some area, for manual mockups

- web version

- easier way to define magic tuneable constants
	- and maybe to recalculate fixedish things if they change?

- more advanced road modeling, like https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/Street_area

## Conga line idea
